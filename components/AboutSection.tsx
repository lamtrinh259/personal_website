              Hi, my name is Lam and I am an {" "}
              <span className="font-bold">analytical</span>,
              <span className="font-bold"> entrepreneurial</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold"> quadrilingual</span> Web3 Product Manager / Engineer and full-stack data scientist.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I graduated from the number 1 international MBA program (Thunderbird School of Global Management) in the world,
              focusing on Global Management in 2015. I have high analytical and interpersonal skills. I was working for
              Harley-Davidson Japan and was in charge of growing the Parts, Accessories, and General Merchandise business
              for the Japan market. Before that, I was in charge of developing the nascent after-sales fleet support program
              worldwide for Mitsubishi FUSO.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Recently, there are two things that get me going every day: listening to thought-provoking audio-books + writings,
              and talking to people in Web3 & Entrepreneurship in my own podcast on YouTube. I want to make Web3 topics
              accessible for people both inside and outside of the crypto space, and also highlight the entrepreneurial
              journey of founders in both Web2 (non-blockchain) and Web3 spaces.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am passionate about {" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
                Web3, traveling, entrepreneurship, data science
              </span>{" "}
              and learning foreign languages. Currently, I live in Tokyo, Japan. ðŸ™‚
